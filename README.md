#Spoofing Face Recognition With 3D Masks
----------------------------------------

A MatLab project for the course of Multimedia Data Security held at the University of Trento.

The aim of this project is to implement a Matlab script that enables to discern between real faces and spoofing attempts using 3D printed masks in order to gain illegitimate access to systems.
